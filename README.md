# Self-Driven Insightful Mindset Project - 

In this project, my focus was not only on the technical side but also on building something equally important for a Data Analyst – a "self-driven insightful mindset".

🔹 Independently exploring data
🔹 Identifying meaningful patterns
🔹 Deriving actionable insights without external direction

I believe this mindset is what helps transform raw data into valuable business outcomes. This project gave me the opportunity to strengthen that skill, and I’m excited to apply it in solving real-world problems.
